# Undesirable Company Modpack

![image](icon.png)

A modpack made mostly for my friends and I. Lots of QoL changes and fixes, quite a few extra interiors and a little bit of new content.

Made for v72, aiming to only use mods updated for it but tested on Windows and Linux either way.

As of v0.2.0, I have added Emblem and created some dumb backgrounds and headers, with custom boot and loading text. I'll expand upon this eventually and add in a custom loading screen too.

Now has more interiors and also reviving! Feel free to change the revive config depending on how OP you consider it. We just thought it best to avoid people being dead for most of the round immediately.
