# Undesirable Company Modpack

![image](icon.png)

A modpack made mostly for my friends and I. Lots of QoL changes and fixes, quite a few extra interiors and a little bit of new content.

Made for v72, aiming to only use mods updated for it but tested on Windows and Linux either way.

As of v0.2.0, I have added Emblem and created some dumb backgrounds and headers, with custom boot and loading text. I'll expand upon this eventually and add in a custom loading screen too.
