            TN: Funny Notes
            If the player has not died, and has no performance notes to display,
            one of these will be chosen at random, so that nobody has no notes.

            TN: Generic Death Messages
            Generally, causes of death like bludgeoning, strangulation, and blasts will be overridden by messages specific to that type.
            These are fallbacks for when there is no specific message. Try to make these broadly applicable.
