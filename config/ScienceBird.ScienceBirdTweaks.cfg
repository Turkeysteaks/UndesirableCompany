Auto Teleport Bodies = false

## Whenever a player is teleported but their body cannot be recovered, an alternative notification to the 'body collected' scrap notification will appear.

## A blacklist of object names to leave untouched during a blackout. If a light object's parent has the same name as one of these names, it will be skipped.

[A. Player Cam Tweaks]

## By default, changes the angle and position of the player cam to look up at players from below their chin (which is slightly more realistic, lets you see more of their surroundings, and is funny). The angle and position are configurable below, so theoretically you can put it wherever you want.
# Setting type: Boolean
# Default value: false
Low Angle Player Cam = true

## How much the camera should be angled up or down (negative values look up at the player from below their head).

# Acceptable value range: From -3 to 3
Player Cam Closeness = 0.5

## How much extra distance the camera should render (increase this to see more of the area surrounding the player). The vanilla base is 11, so if you set this to 11 as well you'll get double the render distance at 22.
