## v0.4.2
- Updated mods:
    - mrov: mrovLib
    - Beaniebe: Deepcore_Mines

- Added LethalMoonUnlocks. Currently set to just discounts, with discounts gained upon each purchase as well as occasionally on completing a quota.
- Added SCP related things. Theoretically, if I have config'd correctly, they should be exclusive to the 'Secret Lab' moon. I will be removing these mods if they don't play nice with the configs, as I'd rather keep the enemies fairly vanilla in most moons

    - ProjectSCP: PSCP106
    - ProjectSCP: SCP939
    - ProjectSCP: SCP682
